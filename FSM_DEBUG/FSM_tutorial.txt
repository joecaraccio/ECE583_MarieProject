FSM tutorial

This FSM module is a debugging tool used to quickly and easily read register values. It
uses a keyboard to select the register, and then displays the contents of that register on
a seven segment display. It is implemented using a finite state machine.

After programming the device in vivado, the keyboard accepts 8 different inputs.

m key: Loads and displays contents of MAR.

b key: Loads and displays contents of MBR.

i key: Loads and displays contents of IR.

p key: Loads and displays contents of PC.

n key: Loads and displays contents of INREG.

o key: Loads and displays contents of OUTREG.

a key: Loads and displays contents of AC.

r key: RESET key, this key MUST be used after every register load if you want to load another register.
